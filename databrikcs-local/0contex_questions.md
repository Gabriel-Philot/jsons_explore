Use json_databrick_01.py as a reference when receiving the questions

Keep the same pattern of the json_databrick_01.py file using the magic commands

Retriving the same imports and estructuring the question in the logs like it's in the template.

Create new file .py never change the template

Create the json inside the new file, respecting the pattern of the template and also the pattern of the question provided

Remember that we are using databricks as engine so use the magic commands and databricks SQL related patterns do deal with Json.

Also use the logger same that is in the template.....

Dont miss any step of the process said before.
